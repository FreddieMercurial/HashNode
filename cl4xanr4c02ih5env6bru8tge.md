## A Security Reboot for a modern world

As you probably know, Multi-Factor authentication is very important to protect your account.

Multi-Factor is simply having more than just a password, but typically people are talking about “something you have and something you know”.

For a long time mobile phones have served as a “thing you have” in the form of being a destination for text messages where they can send a security code. Even this has been hacked by [“SIM jacking”](https://news.trendmicro.com/2022/02/23/what-is-a-sim-swap-scam-how-to-stay-protected/) and [“port jacking”](https://www.letstalk.com/cellphones/guides/port-out-scams/) which can lose you control of your account if you become targeted in any way.

It has been a growing problem from Russians and other foreign and domestic hackers for several years but the war in Ukraine has caused those bad actors to be utilizing this method increasingly.

To protect yourself- everywhere you can, use a “mobile app” authentication rather than SMS. When you’re creating accounts like bank accounts, think about where is your most secure account.

One Microsoft or Google email address should be your primary email address. This account becomes your master “identity”. It will be protected by all of that company’s resources and the multi-factor methods we’ve discussed. You should generally have that as your primary email for everything and then have something like a Gmail (or opposite of the above) as a backup method and make sure that is registered on the above as well.

You should have a hierarchy.

Get a family [1Password](https://www.1password.com) account (or [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com), [KeePass](https://keepass.info/), [BitWarden](https://bitwarden.com/), or similar)  
You should use that as your primary password vault. Your life.

That should be protected by a very good password that you ONLY use for that.

Make sure 1Password or that Vault is also protected by a mobile app (not SMS) and preferably a HARDWARE SECURITY KEY ([token2](https://www.token2.com/home), [yubikey](https://www.yubico.com/products/?utm_source=bing&utm_medium=pd:search&utm_campaign=US_B2C_LeadGen_Bing_SEM_Brand&utm_content=&msclkid=96010e342b21120635fd6c737ea40a71)) which you can also link to your Microsoft and Gmail accounts. Have the Vault app on every device you use.

Once you have a hardware security key and a mobile app security (Microsoft or Google Authenticator) and a password vault those are your life. Your everything. Protect the hardware security key in your safe- or somewhere besides an office desk or somewhere accessible. You should only need it every few months or when you add a new device or reset a browser (but usually you are given multiple options)

Microsoft Edge or Firefox or Safari’s password vaults are be considered safe, but basically think of them as copies of your vault. Update your vault (1Password, LastPass, etc) first and use that browser helper when setting passwords through websites, etc. Then when your browser asks you to save, you can usually disable it and rely on 1Password, or you can let it update the in-browser version if you want it handy and recognize the risks.

Make sure you generate a new password for every site.

In theory I don’t know the password to anything (except my main vault and even that I actually have stored on a hardware device that’s a whole other writeup…). Torture won’t help. You need my 1Password account and my phone and my security key (to set up new devices).

Security is a real and increasing threat. Hackers are getting better automated tools and AI.  
  
Please, I beg you, go through every account you have of importance, change the passwords if you haven’t recently, and update your main vault password if you haven’t very recently. Write it down for a while if you have to. Consider a phrase, capitalizing the first letters, removing spaces, and adding symbols perhaps between instead. “%This@IsMyPassword!” is incredibly secure.

To anyone who understands information theory and security and is in an infuriating argument with someone who does not (possibly involving mixed case), I sincerely apologize.

When generating passwords for sites, make sure to generate the maximum length and complexity the site will allow (eg 14 characters with symbols).

Exceptions: I sometimes have slightly less complex/long passwords for things I have to type into TVs- though most everyone has gotten better about letting you do it in a browser and then have a short code you type into the app (Netflix, Amazon, etc).

Also enable the [WatchTower](https://watchtower.1password.com/) in 1Password (also known as “[Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)” and other similar things in other vaults) which compares your usernames and passwords securely against known compromised email/password dumps released by hacker groups.

Use something like Norton Life Lock or through your credit to monitor for activity on your email primary and old email addresses.

Get yourself a hardware security key of each type (a fob and a Yubikey) which you then use to protect your 1Password.

1Password (and probably others) also has a way to “scan”/input those QR code keys called TOTPs (these are one type of “Mobile App” authentication, though Microsoft, Google and others have their own notification/tap/yes this is me type systems) which I mentioned above and you can then activate on every site that allows.

This way your phone gets you into 1Password and 1Password gets you into everything else. It’ll even copy the “mobile app” “one time code” into the clipboard so you can click/tap “Paste” (or ctrl+v, etc) if it doesn’t auto-fill it in for you. Youtube has great videos to show you how do do the QR code authentication on your phone or computer for the various sites with 1Password.

I have a Microsoft authenticator and a hardware fob that both generate the same time based number- these both get me into 1Password evenly for redundancy.  
I use MS Authenticator for very little else except Microsoft specific things like the tap authentication and some work related items.  
I have a YubiKey that are also attached to my Microsoft and my 1Password and google accounts.

This is another backup to prevent being locked out or having it hacked out from under you.

1Password has literally passwords for everything else.

It has a place for credit cards, social security numbers, and notes and anything you can think of.

Make 1Password your life.

Take the time to really and honestly reset your security life today. Starting with your most important things- bank, alarm company, etc.  
Share the passwords in 1Password with your spouses.

This will save your money and maybe your life.

Bonus: I additionally have a [Mooltipass](https://www.mymooltipass.com/) which protects my 1Password. I don’t know my main password. All I know is the code to my mooltipass. This turns my one password into this one device.
